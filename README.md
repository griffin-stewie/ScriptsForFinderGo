# Scripts For FinderGo

This repository is for sample Apple Script files for [FinderGo](https://github.com/onmyway133/FinderGo)

## How to use

First, you have to build and install my forked version of FinderGo from https://github.com/griffin-stewie/FinderGo/commit/351bf453315620b90b6eef4689da0e61cb607a40

Copy script files you want directory under `~/Library/Application Scripts/com.onmyway133.FinderGo.FinderSyncExtension/`.
